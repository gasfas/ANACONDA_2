For installation:
- copy the 'package' folder (included in the repository) to your local system.
- add this folder to the path (only the folder, not the subfolders), either by the command:
	addpath(fullfile('path','to','folder', ...., 'package'))
  or do this by right-clicking on the folder in the file browser in MATLAB, and click 'add to path'.
- if you want to include the package automatically, please 

you are now ready to use all functions within the package. 

Use the fs-big GUI (under development) by writing 'GUI.fs_big.main' in your command window.
